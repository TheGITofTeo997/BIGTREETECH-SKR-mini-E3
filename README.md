# Ender 3 - Marlin 2.0.9.3 - SKR Mini E3 V3.0 + CR-Touch
This is my personal configuration for the Ender 3 printer running Marlin. Since I've made many hardware upgrades I decided to compile myself Marlin for my needs, starting with this fork. If you have a similar hardware configuration, this firmware should suit your needs.

I will show you a detailed list of the upgrades I made and how the firmware has been accordingly modified. The list will be ketp updated for as long as I can, so will be the firmware.

# Main features
The main feature on this firmware, is that it runs on the silent board SKR Mini E3 V3 with the probe CR-Touch (genuine BL-Touch works aswell) inserted into the 5-pin probe slot, without any rewiring. For this, and many other tweaks, we have to thank the main author of the fork (Seelekind). Thanks!

I've also tried to keep an eye on security (i.e. Z positions) including some tweaks.
